      <summary>Have you heard about <code>details</code>?</summary>
      <p>
        It's a pretty useful element that handles accordion / collapsed text
        natively!
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>So how does it work?</summary>
      <p>
        You wrap a <code>details</code> element around any block of HTML
        content. The browser will collapse that block of text until a user opens
        the <code>details</code> block.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once a user opens a <code>details</code> block, they'll be able to read
        all that hidden content!
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want the details block open by default, include the
        <code>open</code> attribute on the opening tag:
      </p>
      <pre><code><​details open>...<​/details></code></pre>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>But how do I set a custom title?</summary>
      <p>That's pretty manageable too! Use the <code>summary</code> element.</p>
      <p>
        Put a <code>summary</code> at the beginning of your details element and
        <b>Boom!</b> - you've got a custom title for your
        <code>details</code> block.
      </p>
      <p>
        No worries if you don't add a <code>summary</code>. The browser will put
        the word "Details" in there for you. (After all, users need something to
        click!)
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>That's cool, but what about styles?</summary>
      <p>
        Yes, you're covered there too! Style the <code>details</code> element
        however you like. Give it a border, some padding, whatever.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <code>summary</code> element is where the <code>▸</code> marker
        lives. If you want to get rid of that, there is a prefixed
        pseudo-element selector <code>::-webkit-details-marker</code>: set that
        to <code>display: none</code> for WebKit browsers. In Firefox, it's much
        simpler: set the <code>summary</code> to <code>display: block</code> or
        <code>flex</code> (anything but the native
        <code>display: list-item</code>) and you'll get rid of the
        <code>▸</code> for you.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Ok, ok, but what about styling based on state?</summary>
      <p>
        Once again, <code>details</code> has got your back! When a
        <code>details</code> block is open, it has the
        <code>open</code> attribute that I mentioned earlier. To style it (or
        its children) based on its state, use <code>details[open] { }</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note: there's no <code>closed</code> attribute: styles you apply by
        "default" will be used on the closed state.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>But this requires JavaScript, right?</summary>
      <p>
        Open the JS panel on this pen. Clean as a whistle! This is handled
        totally by the browser.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>What about accessibility? Is that the catch?</summary>
      <p>
        Sorry to disappoint you. Since these are native HTML elements, they
        provide useful semantic information to screen readers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Screen readers will typically read the <code>summary</code> for a
        collapsed <code>details</code> block (and communicate that it's
        collapsed). They'll also provide an interactive hook for users to open
        the <code>details</code> block. If the <code>details</code> is already
        expanded, they'll read the whole content.
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't rely on assistive tech to read the web, so I'm probably not
        aware of some limitations or drawbacks to using <code>details</code> and
        <code>summary</code>, but I suspect their AX is at least as good as (if
        not better than) most JavaScript-dependent accordion solutions.
      </p>

      <summary>Excellent! More information, please!</summary>

        You bet! Here are some great resources on <code>details</code> &amp;

    <details>
      <summary>But what about cross-browser compatibility?</summary>
      <p>
        Yeah, sorry. Here's some bad news. IE, Edge, and Opera Mini don't
        currently support <code>details</code>/<code>summary</code> with native
        open/close behavior (check out
        <a
          href="https://caniuse.com/#feat=details"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener"
          >caniuse data for <code>details</code></a
        >).
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        These browsers will show all your <code>details</code> elements
        expanded. That's not the worst though: it's a bit of progressive
        enhancement: if the browser doesn't support the native UI behavior, the
        content will still be visible to users.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's unlikey IE11 will be getting any updates on this front, but there's
        hope for Edge! If this is important to you, please

        >. (Or just wait for Edge to use Chromium, I guess. 😕)
      </p>
      <p>
        If you do need to have open/close behavior in IE11 (or any other
        non-supporting browser), you'll probably need a polyfill. This
