            The Swiss psychologist and psychiatrist Carl Jung was one of the
            major forces responsible for bringing psychological (having to do
            with the mind and its processes) thought and its theories into the
            twentieth century.

            The work of Sigmund Freud, the Austrian founder of psychoanalysis,
            marked the beginning of a modern, dynamic psychology by providing
            the first well-organized explanation of the inner mental forces
            determining human behavior.

            Austrian psychiatrist Alfred Adler was credited with developing
            several important theories on the motivation of human behavior. He
            founded the school of individual psychology, a comprehensive
            "science of living" that focuses on the uniqueness of the individual
            and a person's relationships with society.
